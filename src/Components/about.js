            <p>My name is <b>Emily</b> and I am currently an apprentice. I created this website to demonstrate the skills I have been learning, specifically <b>React JS,</b> which incorperates elements of <b>HTML and CSS.</b></p>
            <p>I have a background in programming, and before the apprenticeship I completed an <b>A Level in Computer Science. </b>Building this website has allowed me to build on existing programming skills, whilst learning a new language and skillset.</p>
